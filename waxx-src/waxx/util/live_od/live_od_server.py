"""
ZMQ REP server running inside the liveOD GUI process.

Receives INIT_RUN / WAIT_CAM_READY / SHOT_COMPLETE / END_RUN messages
from the experiment client (possibly on a different machine) and
coordinates HDF5 file creation, camera spawning, and final data saving.

The server runs as a QThread to stay compatible with PyQt6 event dispatch
on the GUI machine. All HDF5 I/O stays on the server side; the experiment
client never needs the data drive mounted.
